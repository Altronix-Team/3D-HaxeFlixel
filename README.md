## Info ðŸ”µ
This uses the [Away3D](https://github.com/openfl/away3d) frame work from OpenFL and makes it renderable in [HaxeFlixel](https://github.com/HaxeFlixel/flixel) as a FlxSprite. With some rendering workarounds in the FlxView3D and Main File, this is possible.

[Away3D](https://github.com/openfl/away3d) uses View3D as its primary container so that is what the FlxView3D works with. 

### Limitations ðŸ”´
- Can not render a model with more then **ONE** texture.
- Only supports the follow file formats; `AC3D, Collada, Max3DS, MD2, MD5, OBJ`

## Requirements ðŸŸ¡

- The Away3D OpenFL Library; ` openfl install away3d`
- Adding the Library to your Project.xml; `<haxelib name="away3d"/>`
